1.1.5. Alternative installation processes 
What are the methods of implementation/ conversion of new systems?
Parallel: 
* Both system work at the same time (in parallel) for a short peiod of time
Advantages:
limited risks
outputs of both systems can be compared to ensure that the new system is working properly
if hte new system fails, the company can revert or return to the old system 
the old system can be terminated after the company is sure of the efficiency of the new system 

disadvatnges 
extra cost
workload 
various organizational tasks
not efficent if the old and new systems have completely different processing tasks, functions, input or outputs 

Bing Bang or direct:
*Company plugs in the new system and unplugs the old one at the same time 
disadnavtages 
risky 
alll users need to be trained appropriately before the switvh takes place 

pilot 
*used in large organizations that have multiple sites. The new system is introduced in one of the sites and extented to
the other sites over time
*The first group that adopts the new system is called pilot site or pilot group
advantages 
low risk
the pilot sites can be used as a model for the rest of the company
after the new system is proved to be succesfull, its implemented to the rest of the company using a changeover 
method (usually direct)

Phased
company converts one module at a time, meaning that different parts of the system are converted in different times
disadvnatges 
training period extended 
adoption of the new system takes longer 


1.1.6
data migration
refers to the trasnfer of data between different formats, storage stypes and systems

problems that may arise
incapabiblity of moving the information due to incompability or non-recognizable data stuctures 
data may be lost or not transferred due to a non-complete data transfer or error on the process
data can be miss interpreted dude to inompability due to each convetions from each vounrty concerning date time and meansuting 
units 

1.1.7
types of testig 
stages, definition and importance
